Garlic Butter Pork Bites with Lemon Green Beans

Prep/Cook Time: 30 mins

Ingredients:
1 1/2 lb (650 g) pork chops, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 tablespoon cajun seasoning mix (preferably low sodium)
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup (60ml) vegetable broth
Juice of 1/2 lemon
4 cloves garlic finely chopped
1 lb (450g) green beans, trimmed and blanched (if thin, no need to blanch the green beans)
Red chili pepper flakes, optional
Fresh chopped parsley, for the garnish
Lemon slices, for the garnish

Directions:
1. To make the garlic butter pork cubes: In a shallow plate, sprinkle pork bites with cajun 
seasoning and toss to coat well. Heat 2 teaspoons of oil in a skillet or pan over medium-high heat until hot.

2. Sear the pork bites in batches for 2-3 minutes on each side until edges are crispy and browned, 
adding extra oil as needed. Remove the browned pork bites from the skillet and set aside.

3. Reduce heat to medium. Add butter to the skillet and heat until melted. Sauté the chopped 
garlic until fragrant (about 30 seconds), while scraping up any browned bits from the pan. Deglaze 
with lemon juice and vegetable broth.

4. to blanch green beans, cook them in boiling water for 2 or 3 minutes, then drain and soak in ice-cold water to stop 
the cooking process and keep the nice green color of the vegetable. Throw blanched green beans into the pan and toss 
in the lemon butter sauce to coat well. Cook green beans for 3-4 minutes, turning regularly using tongs.

5. Push cooked green beans on the side and return the pork bites into the pan. Toss pork bites 
through the garlic butter sauce to evenly coat. Serve the garlic butter pork bites and lemon green beans with 
lemon slices, sprinkled fresh parsley and red chili pepper flakes if you like. Enjoy! ❤️
