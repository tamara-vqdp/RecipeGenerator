INGREDIENTS:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
3 cups frozen chopped broccoli
1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tubes (8 ounces each) refrigerated crescent rolls

DIRECTIONS:
Step 1:
Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat 6-8 minutes or until beef is no longer pink, 
breaking beef into crumbles; drain. Stir in broccoli, cheese, sour cream, salt and pepper; heat through.

Step 2:

Spoon half the beef mixture lengthwise down center of rectangle.

On each long side, cut 1-in.-wide strips at an angle, about 3 in. into the center. Fold 1 strip from each side over 
filling and pinch ends together; repeat.

Step 4:
Repeat with remaining ingredients to make second braid. Bake 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
