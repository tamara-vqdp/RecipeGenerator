Instructions
1. Chop the chicken into bite-size chunks and place in a mixing bowl.

2. Add the yogurt and half of the spices (the other half will be used in the curry sauce), 
salt and pepper and mix well.

3. Cover and allow to marinate for at least 10 minutes but up to 24 hours in the fridge. 

4. In a large, deep braiser/pan, heat a splash of oil then brown the chicken on both sides in batches.

5. Remove from the pan then add the onion, garlic and ginger to the pan and cook until soft and fragrant.

salt, pepper and sugar.

7. Add the chicken back in to the sauce and pour in the cream. Reduce the heat and allow to simmer for 15 minutes 
until the sauce has thickened slightly and the chicken is cooked through. 

8. Serve with yogurt, coriander/cilantro, rice and roti or naan bread.
