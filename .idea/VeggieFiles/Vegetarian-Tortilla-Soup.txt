Instructions
1. Heat oven to 375F.

2. Make the tortilla strips: Brush the tortillas lightly with olive oil on each side. Using a pizza cutter, 
slice them in half, then into thin strips. Place the strips on a baking sheet and sprinkle with kosher salt. 
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until crispy and lightly browned.

3. Prep the veggies: Peel and dice the onion. Dice the green pepper. Peel and mince the garlic. Drain and rinse the beans.

4. Make the soup: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and sauté the onion until translucent,
about 5 minutes. Add the green pepper and the garlic and sauté for 2 minutes. Stir in the oregano and the cumin for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, beans, corn, adobo sauce, broth, and kosher salt. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 10 minutes. Taste and add additional adobo sauce or kosher salt if desired.

5. Prep the garnishes: Slice the radishes. Slice the lime into wedges.

6. Serve: To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and allow to cool to warm. Garnish with the tortilla strips, 
radishes, torn cilantro leaves, hot sauce, and plenty of lime juice.
