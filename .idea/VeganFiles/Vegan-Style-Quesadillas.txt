Vegan Style Quesadillas

INGREDIENTS
1/2 cup red onion, diced
1 1/2 cup avocado, ripened - 2 avocados
4 large flour tortillas
1/2 cup black beans, canned
1 ½ cup dairy free cheese - white or orange
1 cup tomatoes, diced
2 tablespoons dairy free butter

Vegan crema:
1/4 cup dairy free sour cream
1 tablespoon lime juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons fresh parsley or cilantro

Instructions:
1. Begin by chopping the tomatoes and onion into small pieces. Then mash the avocado and add salt to it.

2. To make this Tik Tok trick, you’ll need to cut the tortilla from one edge to it's center. 
This cut allows you to flip one side over the other. The result will be a layered triangle.

3. Once you cut it, you’ll have four quarters. In two of them, on opposite sides, put some cheese. Add some tomato 
over one side and some onion to the other.

4. Spoon some mashed avocado in the triangles that remain empty and place some black beans over one of those avocado triangles.

5. Flip one triangle over the next one clockwise and continue until you have one triangle as in the photos.

6. Add some oil or dairy free butter to a skillet and once the oil is hot, cook each quesadilla from both sides.

Vegan crema:
Chopped parsley or cilantro and mix it with sour cream and lime juice.
Drizzle the lime sour cream on top of the finished quesadillas and eat up!
