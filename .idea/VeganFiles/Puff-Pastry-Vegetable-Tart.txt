Puff Pastry Vegetable Tart

Prep Time: 15 mins
Cook Time: 25 mins

Ingredients:
1 block (500 g) puff pastry
1 onion sliced
1 (150 g) red pepper diced
4 (80 g) mushrooms sliced
1 (150 g) zucchini / courgette sliced
handful (80 g) cherry tomatoes halved
2 cloves garlic finely chopped
2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 tsp dried herbs
basil optional for serving

Instructions:
1. Prepare your puff pastry block. If frozen, defrost overnight in the fridge or 2 hours at room temperature. 
If chilled, remove from the fridge 15 minutes before using. You can also use a ready rolled sheet.

2. Preheat your oven to 200°C or 390°F.

3. Chop all the veggies - the onion, pepper, mushrooms, zucchini, tomatoes and garlic - then toss them in the 
olive oil, herbs, salt and pepper.

4. Lightly dust a wooden board with flour and roll out the puff pastry into a rectangle of 25 x 35 cm (10 x 14 inch).

5. Transfer the pastry to a lined baking tray and using a sharp knife, lightly score a border 1 cm in from the 
edge of the pastry rectangle. This allows the pastry to puff up and make a nice border to the tart.

6. Next, spread the vegetables evenly over the pastry base, avoiding the border around the edge.

7. Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes until the puff pastry edge is crisp and golden brown. Transfer to a wooden 
board to slice and serve, and top with fresh basil if desired.
