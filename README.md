# RecipeGenerator
Random Recipe Generator with Food Catergories

PURPOSE:
The purpose of this app is to generate random recipes with different food catergories. 

METHODS:
The files are created locally and imported into java by adding them to an arraylist
I have used read and write methods to write the recipes created locally to a txt file in java 
I created 5 directories in java in the .idea project folder, each folder corresponds to a food catergory
each file is then created and written to the created folders 
Using Random() method i randmoised the files from the folders 

CHALLENGES:
1. I first had challenges reading and writing the files from the arraylists i can created in each food class
2. I was also struggling to create files within a folder then write to the files using the files i created locally on my computer
3. At first, i wasnt able to extract the name of each file in order to write to them, i managed to figure it out after testing out various different methods

FUTURE:
1. To further improve this project, i want to import the files from a cloud platform like my google drive(Google API). This would allow for better 
management of files and easier intergration if other users test my program.
2. I would like to try transfer this project to JavaFX, to emulate a real life app with buttons, pages, links
